Hey there :wave:,

I'm Swapnil. I'm a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and reliable systems.

I have a strong background in computer science and have worked on a variety of problems in the field.

Currently I'm working on building native financial integrations and AI-first accounting software at a US accounting-tech startup.
