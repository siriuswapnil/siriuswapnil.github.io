I completed my 4 year undergrad in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra(a top 50 engg college in India) with a GPA of 3.73/4.0. With a perfect 10/10 in core CS subjects like Operating Systems, Networking, Algorithms, Databases and Machine Learning, I was offered a merit based specialisation in Computational Intelligence which allowed me to study subjects like Deep Learning with a greater depth. I was also awarded merit based scholarships multiple times in the form of tuition waivers.

My programming experience has been largely varied allowing me work on diverse problems in Computer Science. My interest in the fields of computer science started early on in high school when I participated in a nation-wide cyber security contest(commonly called CTFs) achieving the runners' up position amount 2000+ students. During my undergrad, I completed a total of 13 months of full time internships at various software engineering positions. My first significant internship was at the end of my sophomore year in 2020, where I was part of the highly selective cohort of Google Summer of Code, working with Wikimedia Foundation on a project to make functional and educational offline maps for people in remote corners of the world. At the end of my junior year, I was involved with Prof. Samia Bouzefarne at CNAM, Paris where I explored privacy preserving machine learning for edge devices. In my final semester I worked as a backend engineering intern in one of India's leading ed-tech startups. Post completion of my undergraduate degree, I joined a Y-Combinator funded mobility startup as their founding engineer. After building multiple solutions for their application, I moved to a US accounting-tech startup where I mostly work on building native financial integrations and our AI-first accounting software.
